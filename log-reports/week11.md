### Introduction 

- Project theme and context: 
    - Explain (briefly) how the model of a Hoeffding tree works.
    - Explain what a FGPA is, and why it was initially chosen for this work. 
    - Explain the application of pramas in the vitis architecture. 
    - Supply information about the existing codebase given by the professor. 

### Process/Activities/Plan 

- Describe the hardware and platform tools used. 
- Overall plan was to increase the performance of the model (hardware wise). 
- Work methodology: 
    - Apply a change to the code (refactoring or adding a pragma), compile the program (in HW emulation form), gather and register results. 
    - Tasks were guided by the professor's suggestion and warnings/performance markers provided by vitis hls analysis. 
- Talk about each week's topic/objective. 
- Talk about unacomplished but significant objective (sortSample refactoring).


### Product/application/Development

- Give examples of refactored code and added pragmas, explaining why it makes sense to do so, given our objective. 
- Show different graphics on how performance increased over the weeks. 
- Give examples of setbacks, or scenarios that surprised me, explaining why they didn't work. 
- Talk about limitiations: time constraints, adapting to the whole code and  and mainly software issues and bugs using Vitis.



### Conclusions 

- Draw conclusions from the developed work. 
- How impactfull was my work. 
- What went wrong and well etc.
